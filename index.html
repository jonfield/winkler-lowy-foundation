                            <p><strong>Keeping kids in the bunk!</strong> <br>The Winkler Lowy Foundation recognizes the lasting impact of Jewish summer camp on personal growth, community building, and Jewish identity. Through its support of the LA Federation’s Camp Initiative, the foundation helps teens have continued opportunities to return to camp beyond 8th grade when many drop off. By providing resources and support throughout high school, the foundation helps maintain these important connections, allowing young people to keep benefiting from the unique experience and values that Jewish summer camp offers.</p>
